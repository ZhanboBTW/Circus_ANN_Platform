# ðŸŽª Circus ANN Platform

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) platform from scratch using NumPy.

## Features
- Linear (Fully Connected) Layers
- 1D & 2D Convolution Layers
- Activation Layers: ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Softmax
- Manual Backpropagation

## Theme
All components are named with a circus theme to make the learning experience more fun!

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the notebook or script file.
2. Run training with included synthetic data.
3. Check accuracy and loss plots.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- NumPy

## Structure
- `layers/`: Layer definitions
- `activations/`: Activation functions
- `utils/`: Helpers like loss functions, metrics
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebook demo
- `data/`: Sample data
